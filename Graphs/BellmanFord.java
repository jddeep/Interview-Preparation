/*
Same aim as Dijkstras algo - to find shortest paths from a source vertex to other vertices.
Dijkstras doesn't lets us know if a negative cycle exists in the graph, hence the answer can be inaccurate.
Bellman Ford iterates over all the edges for V-1 times. Lastly, +1 time to see if the distances are still getting
minimized. That will signify there exists a negative cycle.
Time complexity - O(VE)
